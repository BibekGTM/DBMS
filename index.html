            <p class="text">In a database, a table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. It represents a logical structure used to store and manage data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).</p>

            <p class="terms">Constraint</p>
            <p class="text">A constraint in a database is a rule or condition that limits the values that can be placed in a column or a combination of columns. It ensures data integrity by enforcing rules on the data.</p>
